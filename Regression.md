# Regression

## Predict label based on features
## Train model with features and known values
## use trained model to predict labels for unknown items
## Type of Regression models
### Bayesian Linear Regression: Linear used for small datasets
### Linear Regression: Rapid training linear model
### Boosted Decision Tree Regression: Rapid training and high accuracy
### Decision Forest Regression: Rapid training and high accuracy
### Fast Forest Quantile Regression: For distribution prediction
### Neural network regression: Slow training and high accuracy
### Ordinal Regression: Ranked order datasets
### Poisson Regression: Event count prediction

# Regression in Azure
## No coding required
## Drag and drop interface

# Step for training a regression model
## Create a pipeline
### Create a pipeline for training model
### Pipeline begins with dataset
## Add and explore a dataset
### Train regression model
### Make a prediction based on characteristics
### Azure ML has sample dataset
## Apply data transformations
### Prepare data for modeling
### Address issues discovered during data exploration
## Execute the pipeline
### Apply data transformation
### Wait for run to complete
## Review transformed data
### Data is ready for model training
### Select visualize to review

# Choose the right number of independent variables
## Underspecified models can be biased: underfitting
## Overspecified models can lack precision
## Models using correct terms are ideal

# Primary Metrics for Regression Evaluation
## R Squared / Predicted R Squared [0, 1] / Adjusted R Squared deals with overfitting
## Mean Squared Error (MSE) / Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
## Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
## P-values for independent variables
## Stepwise regression / best subsets regression
