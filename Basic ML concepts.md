## Types of ML

### Supervised: know the labels (results)
#### Definition
##### Use of well-labeled data
##### Certain data may already have correct answers
#### Regression
##### Predictive modeling: Relationship between dependent and independent varibles
##### Purpose
###### Forecasting
###### Identifying causal relationships
###### Time series modeling
##### Benefits
###### Analyze relationships
###### Identify effect of independent variables
###### Compare effects of scaling
##### Linear Regression
###### Linear relationship between dependent and independent varibles
###### Dependent variable is continuous, independent variables continuous or discrete
###### Detemine best fit (straight line)
##### Logistic Regression
###### Detemine probability of success or failure
###### Dependent varible is binary
##### Polynomial Regression
###### Regression equation
###### Power of independent variable greater than 1
##### Stepwise Regression
###### Presence of multiple independent variables
###### Selection is automated
##### Ridge Regression
###### Highly correlated independent variables
###### Adds bias to regression estimates
###### Reduces occurrence of errors
##### Lasso Regression
###### Reduces variability
###### Improves accuracy of linear models
###### Penalizes absolute size of coefficients
###### Uses absolute values
##### ElasticNet Regression
###### Hybrid of Lasso and Ridge Regression
###### Used for multiple correlated features
###### No limitation on variable selections
#### Classification Algorithm
##### Definition
###### Obtain better boundary conditions
###### Identify target classes
###### Predic target class
##### Common Classification Algorithms
###### Linear classifiers
###### Quadratic classifiers
###### Neural networks
###### Decision trees
###### Support vector machine (SVM)

### Unsupervised: 
#### Definition
##### Raw data only, don't know the labels. 
##### No output variables
#### Type of unsupervised: Clustering
##### Definition
###### Group objects in a cluster
###### Some sort of similarity
##### Clustering Algorithm
###### Objects in a cluster share similarities
###### Objects in different clusters are different
###### Similarity is represented by proximity
##### Clustering Methods
###### Hierarchical
###### Assign points
##### Type of clustering
###### Centroid-based clustering
####### Non-hierarchical clusters
####### Very efficient
####### Reliant on starting conditions
###### Hierarchical Clustering
####### Useful for hierarchical datasets
####### Tree of clusters
####### Any number of clusters can be selected
###### Density-based Clustering
####### Connects areas of high example density
####### Arbitrary shaped distributions
####### Does not assign outliers
####### Problematic with varying density and high dimensions
###### Distribution-based Clustering
####### Data comprised of distributions (e.g., Guassian)
####### Probability decreases as distance from center of distribution grows
#### Type of unsupervised: Association
##### Defintion
###### Create relationships between data objects
###### Useful for discovering new relationships
#### Use cases for Unsupervised Learning
##### Subdivide data based on similarities
##### Detect anomalies
##### Data preprocessing
##### Association mining

### Deep Learning: Neural networks

## ML Tasks

### Train
### Deploy: Make the model available to consumers
### Automate: Tune parameters and algorithms more efficiently
### Manage
### Track

## ML services 

### Anomaly Detection

#### Detect data outliers
#### used for root cause analysis

### Computer Vision

#### Detecting and labeling objects
#### Recognizing patterns
#### Imitating human vision

### NLP
#### Analyze language

#### Generate language

## Datasets

### Collection of data
### Database tables
### can include documents and files
### Importance of Quality
#### Affects machine learning predictions
#### Insights will be compromised
#### Goals differ based on need
#### High quality data is difficult to create and expensive


### Using Datasets
#### Raw data transformation
#### Prediction and insights
### Working with Datasets
#### Maintain a single copy
#### Persitent access to data
#### Collabrate and share

## Data
### Understanding Data
#### Organized Information
#### Rows: data points
#### Columns: features
### Data Type for ML
#### Raw (unlabeled)
##### Easily obtained
##### No features
#### labeled
##### Tagged with at least one label
##### Adds meaning to data
##### Labelling requires human interpretation
##### More complext and expensive

### Features in Data
#### Represents meaningful data, aka attributes, can be analyzed, can be very diverse
#### information about the data
#### Stored in data columns, also referred to as fields

### Examples of Dataset Manipulation
#### Combine datasets
#### Create categories for grouping
#### Modify columns
#### Fill in missing values
#### Generate statistics
#### Apply calculations
#### Normalize data
#### scale values
#### place values into bins
#### Divide into training and testing sets
#### Apply sampling
